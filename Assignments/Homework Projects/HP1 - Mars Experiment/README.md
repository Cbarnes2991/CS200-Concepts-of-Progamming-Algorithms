# Homework Project 1: Mars Experiment

## Downloads

Download the **starter project**. This folder contains the code, as well as a Visual Studio project and a Code::Blocks project.

Extract the zip file somewhere to your hard drive.

**To open in Visual Studio**

Open the following file:

	project files/HP1 - Visual Studio/HP1 - Visual Studio.sln

This is marked as "Microsoft Visual Studio Solution" in Windows.

**To open in Code::Blocks**

Open the following file:

	project files/HP1 - CodeBlocks/HP1 - CodeBlocks.cbp

This is marked as "CBP File" in Windows.

## Rules

* Open book / Open note:

	* Do research for this assignment as-needed. Use your textbook, the web, class example code, etc.
 
* Solo work:

	* This is a solo assignment and you should be working on this alone. This means...:
	
    	* ✓ You can verbally brainstorm with others to discuss the problem and techniques for problem solving.
    	* ✓ Your work must be your own work.
    	* ✓ Email the instructor, or ask in the Slack channel, if you are stuck or need clarification on the instructions.
    	* ✗ You cannot give your code to somebody else for them to "verify their work" with (more often than not they just copy it, and then you both get 0%!)
    	* ✗ You cannot copy another student's work. I will use a diff tool to compare student assignments (and code online). If there is obvious copying, all people involved will receive a 0%.

## Turn in

When you're ready to turn in your work, upload the 

	homework_project_1.cpp 

file to your GitHub repository, and to the D2L Dropbox.

# Introduction

For this program, you will be setting *mission parameters* for a Mars
mission, including the amount of resources produced and consumed
each day.

After setting up the variables, running the simulation will tell you
whether or not your team survives the mission.
